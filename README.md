### Electronic Devices Project

### April 9

A Project that contains clsses and subclasses. This is a mockup exercise where you need to create a UML type diagram for a class of your choosing. Basically create boxes that represent classes, include fields and methods that you would create for the class. Also create subclasses with one more property and method. You should create at least 3 levels.
Example
Electronic Device:

1 properties/ instance variables
1 methods/ functions
3 levels

* Git
* Java 7
* Maven
